        <h4>Dev Log #1:</h4>
        <p>
          Today marks the first day of development for my first website. I am
          both excited and a little nervous, as this is my first time building a
          website from scratch. I have a clear vision of what I want the site to
          look like and what features I want it to have, but I know that there
          will be challenges along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have chosen to use the popular web development framework, React, to
          build the site. I have some experience with React, but I am by no
          means an expert. I know that there will be a learning curve, but I am
          confident that I can figure it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today I will be starting with the basic layout of the site, including
          the header, footer, and navigation menu. I will also be setting up the
          basic structure of the site, including the file structure and the
          routing.

        <h4>Dev Log #2:</h4>
        <p>
          Today was a productive day in the development of my website. I was
          able to finish the basic layout of the site, including the header,
          footer, and navigation menu. The site is starting to take shape, and I
          am pleased with how it is looking so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also spent some time working on the site's routing, which is used to
          control the flow of the site. I used React Router to handle the
          routing, and I was able to get it set up and working correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I will be working on adding some basic functionality to the
          site, such as the ability to create and view a list of items. This
          will be a challenging task, but I am looking forward to it.

        <h4>Dev Log #3:</h4>
        <p>
          Today was a big day for the development of my website. I was able to
          add some basic functionality to the site, including the ability to
          create and view a list of items. This was a challenging task, but I am
          pleased with how it turned out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also spent some time working on the site's design. I wanted to make
          sure that the site is easy to navigate and visually pleasing. I added
          some CSS styles and I think it makes the site look much better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I will be working on adding more advanced functionality to the
          site, such as the ability to edit and delete items from the list. I am
          excited to see how these features will work and how they will improve
          the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I am very pleased with the progress I have made so far on my
          first website. There are still a lot of tasks to be done, but I am
          confident that I can finish it and make it a great website.
